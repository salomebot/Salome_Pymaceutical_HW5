I have analysis data from a preclinical study screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In this study 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. The goal was to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

I have used  Pandas Library, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib libraries and created:
- a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
- a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
- a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
- a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.

The results are the following:
By analysing the Tumor volume (mm3) variation with the different drugs during the 45 days, we can verify that the drug Capomulin caused a decrease of about 20% in the Tumor volume -The spread of Metastatic sites was also lower with the Capomulin drug over the 45 days -The survival rate with treatment with drug Capomulin was roughly of 80%, whereas it ranged between 40-60% with the other treatments

Overall we can conclude that Capomulin was the drug that had better effects in terms of reducing the size of the volume of the tumors, reducing the spreading of metastatic sites and increasing the values of survival rates of mice.
